; An example domain table for the NSC

; Various mandatory things required by RFC 1912, section 4.1
PRIMARY(localhost)
REVERSE(0)
REVERSE(255)
REVERSE(127.0.0, localhost)

; A pretty normal example domain (we act as a primary nameserver for it)

PRIMARY(example.com)

; It also has a couple of sub-domains and one of them resides on another server

PRIMARY(a.example.com)
SECONDARY(b.example.com, 10.0.0.1)

; Here are reverse delegations for two networks. NSC automatically creates
; the PTR records from A records in all mentioned zones. See cf/{0,1}.0.10.

REVERSE(10.0.0, example.com, a.example.com)
REVERSE(10.1.0, example.com, a.example.com, ip6.example.com)

; You can even have reverse zones for larger networks

REVERSE(10.2, a.example.com)

; Here are the examples of classless reverse delegation using subdomains
; and PTR records as recommended by RFC 2317. We use the subdomain names
; recommended by the RFC, however, this is not fixed anywhere and you can
; use any names you like (or your ISP likes).

; In the 10.1.0 network, we define a classless delegation (see cf/0.1.10),
; but we also want to run a secondary server for the subdomain. As usually,
; the REV macro is handy for constructing a reverse domain name.

SECONDARY(REV(10.1.0.128/25), 10.1.0.2)

; And vice versa: we are delegated 10.3.0.64/26, so we want to create
; the corresponding subdomain.

REVERSE(10.3.0.64/26, a.example.com)

; The final challenge: a subdomain with both IPv4 and IPv6 records
; together with the corresponding reverse records (in IPv6 mode, all
; networks are always accompanied by a netmask).
; See cf/ip6.example.com and cf/4.3.2.1.0.c.e.f for details

PRIMARY(ip6.example.com)
REVERSE(fec0:1234::/32, ip6.example.com)
