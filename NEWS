  o  Added FORWARDING macro for generating forward-only zones.
  o  Added BLACKHOLE macro for blackhole zones as per RFC 6303.
     Blackhole zones in example cf/domains updated to use this macro.
  o  Given that BIND does not support combination of options { }
     sections, we do not generate them any longer -- write the
     appropriate options to BIND config file and include the part
     with the list of zones generated by NSC from there. This means
     that BIND_OPTIONS, FORWARD and SLAVE are gone.
  o  When contents of a zone do not change, the version number is
     not incremented.

Version 3.1  [2008-05-21]

  o  Fixes for compatibility problems with recent versions of GNU m4.
  o  Added support for TXT, RP and SRV records.

Version 3.0.1  [2006-11-22]

  Fixed bugs in in the FORWARD and SLAVE macros, causing it to
  generate bogus output sometimes.

Version 3.0  [2005-02-20]

  One year of testing should be good enough, so releasing 2.99b as 3.0
  with almost no changes. The only one is:

  o  ZONE_OPTIONS macro added, allowing to add custom options to zones.

Version 2.99b  [2003-12-21]

  This version has been almost rewritten from scratch. The syntax
  of configuration files is incompatible with the previous versions,
  please read the README again.

  Most important changes:

  o  Support for IPv6.
  o  Much better configuration of classless reverse delegations.
  o  Better documentation and well-commented example files.
  o  The "chkdom" script is gone, use the DNS Sleuth instead.
  o  Cleaned up names of all macros, the namespaces are now clearly
     defined.

Version 2.3  [2001-06-27]

  o  Global parameters (hostmaster mail address etc.) can be set
     in cf/config now.
  o  Autodetect which M4 should be used.
  o  Fixed bugs in convert script.
  o  Generate $TTL to make new releases of bind happy.

Version 2.2  [1999-09-11]

  o  Corrected localhost records.
  o  Name-server restart command can be overriden (useful for setups
     with multiple named's).
  o  Added `convert' script for easy conversion of zone files to NSC
     domain files.
  o  Serial numbers are now Y2K clean.
  o  Added `chkdel' script for checking of zone delegations.
